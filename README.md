# blog-site



Blog project where I can enter the title of a blog post and content and it then shows on the home page.

At the moment anyone is able to compose and delete blog posts. 


I used the following technologies to create this site.

    -MongoDB - To save the blog posts
    -Express - Backend/Server
    -Node.JS - Allow use of JavaScript outside of clientside
    -Vanilla JavaScript - For the dynamic year in the footer
    -HTML5 - Structure of the site
    -CSS3 - For styling of the site
    -Bootstrap - For further styling of the site
